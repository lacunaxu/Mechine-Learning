# DSCI 552: Machine Learning Homework Repository

Welcome to the **DSCI 552 Homework Repository**! This repository contains all my assignments for the **DSCI 552: Machine Learning for Data Science** course.

## üìö Course Description
DSCI 552 is a graduate-level course focused on the core principles and applications of machine learning. The course covers a variety of topics, including:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Classification, regression, and clustering algorithms
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Advanced machine learning concepts such as ensemble learning and deep learning (where applicable)

## üìÇ Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- Each folder represents a separate homework assignment.
- Within each folder, you will find:
  - **Jupyter Notebooks** containing my code and analyses.
  - **Datasets** (if provided or required for the assignment).
  - **Reports** or documentation (if applicable).

### Example Structure:


## üíª Technology Stack
This repository primarily uses the following technologies:
- Python (with libraries such as `NumPy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git for version control

## üåü About Me
I'm a graduate student currently enrolled in the **Master of Science in Applied Data Science** program at USC. This repository showcases my hands-on learning experience in machine learning, including implementations of popular algorithms and analyses of real-world datasets.

## ü§ù Acknowledgments
- **Professor:** Special thanks to the professor for their guidance and insightful lectures.
- **Course Materials:** Some of the datasets and starter code are provided as part of the coursework.
